====================================================

This document outlines a structured development plan for enhancing the AI PDF Reader application with the following features, optimized for implementation using AI coding tools like Cursor or Claude Code.

1.  AI API Implementation
    
2.  Database
    
3.  Recent PDFs and Chat History Inside Each PDF
    

Development Phases
------------------

The implementation is organized into three major phases to ensure a logical progression and minimize integration challenges:

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

*   AI API Implementation
    
*   Database Setup
    

### Phase 2: User Experience & History

*   Recent PDFs and Chat History Inside Each PDF
    

AI Tool Implementation Guidelines
---------------------------------

When using AI coding tools to implement these features:

1.  **Provide Project Context**
    
    *   Share the full file structure using ls -R before starting work
        
    *   Include current component code and dependencies
        
    *   Explain the application architecture as described in documentation.html
        
2.  **Break Features into Smaller Tasks**
    
    *   Present one task at a time to the AI tool
        
    *   Focus on implementing a single component or function per prompt
        
    *   Verify each implementation before moving to dependent components
        
3.  **Specify Implementation Details**
    
    *   Include exact file paths for new/modified files
        
    *   Specify imports and dependencies explicitly
        
    *   Provide clear acceptance criteria for each component
        
4.  **Iterative Review Process**
    
    *   After each implementation, review for adherence to project patterns
        
    *   Test components in isolation before integration
        
    *   Address any issues or inconsistencies before proceeding
        

Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
----------------------------
