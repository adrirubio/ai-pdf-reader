## AI Tool Implementation Guidelines

When using AI coding tools to implement these features:

1. **Provide Project Context**
   - Share the full file structure using `ls -R` before starting work
   - Include current component code and dependencies
   - Explain the application architecture as described in documentation.html

2. **Break Features into Smaller Tasks**
   - Present one task at a time to the AI tool
   - Focus on implementing a single component or function per prompt
   - Verify each implementation before moving to dependent components

3. **Specify Implementation Details**
   - Include exact file paths for new/modified files
   - Specify imports and dependencies explicitly
   - Provide clear acceptance criteria for each component

4. **Iterative Review Process**
   - After each implementation, review for adherence to project patterns
   - Test components in isolation before integration
   - Address any issues or inconsistencies before proceeding

---

## Phase 1: Core Architecture Improvements

### 1. State Management Implementation (2 weeks)

**Objective:** Replace the current component-based state with a centralized state management solution.

#### AI Implementation Approach

When implementing this feature with AI tools, follow these steps:

1. **Initial Setup - Provide this information to AI:**
   - Current state management approach in App.jsx, PDFViewer.jsx, and AIPanel.jsx
   - Complete file structure using `ls -R`
   - Any existing patterns or conventions in the codebase

2. **Break down implementation for AI tools:**
   - Ask AI to generate one file at a time
   - Request code review for each generated file before integration
   - Test components individually after implementation

#### Week 1: Design & Setup

1. **State Structure Design**
   - Map out complete application state tree
   - Identify key state slices: pdfState, chatState, uiState, userState
   - Document state relationships and interactions

   **AI Task Example:**
   ```
   Create a detailed state structure diagram for the Redux store, showing all state slices, 
   their properties, and relationships between them based on the current component states in App.jsx, 
   PDFViewer.jsx, and AIPanel.jsx.
   ```

2. **Technology Selection & Setup**
   - Install Redux toolkit and React-Redux
   ```bash
   npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
   ```
   - Configure store with dev tools and middleware
   - Create directory structure:
   ```
   src/
   ├── state/
   │   ├── store.js
   │   ├── slices/
   │   │   ├── pdfSlice.js
   │   │   ├── chatSlice.js
   │   │   ├── uiSlice.js
   │   │   └── userSlice.js
   │   └── selectors/
   ```

   **AI Task Example:**
   ```
   Create the Redux store setup in src/state/store.js that configures Redux with the
   following slices: pdfSlice, chatSlice, uiSlice, and userSlice. Include Redux DevTools
   setup and any necessary middleware.
   ```

3. **Core Slice Implementation**
   - Implement PDF slice (current document, viewing options)
   - Implement Chat slice (messages, sessions, AI responses)
   - Implement UI slice (current view, panels visibility)

   **AI Task Example:**
   ```
   Implement the pdfSlice.js Redux slice at src/state/slices/pdfSlice.js based on the current
   PDF-related state in the PDFViewer.jsx component. Include the following state and actions:
   - Current PDF path
   - Page navigation state
   - Zoom/scale settings
   - Selected text
   ```

#### Week 2: Integration & Refactoring

1. **Component Refactoring**
   - Refactor App.jsx to use Redux store
   - Refactor PDFViewer.jsx to connect to store
   - Refactor AIPanel.jsx to use chat state
   - Create custom hooks for common state operations

   **AI Task Example:**
   ```
   Refactor the PDFViewer.jsx component to use the Redux store instead of local state.
   Replace useState hooks with useSelector and useDispatch. Here is the current component code:
   [include PDFViewer.jsx code]
   
   The component should use the following state from the store:
   - pdfState.filePath instead of pdfPath state
   - pdfState.currentPage instead of currentPage state
   - pdfState.scale instead of scale state
   
   And dispatch the following actions:
   - setPdfPath
   - setCurrentPage
   - setScale
   - setSelectedText
   ```

2. **Testing & Optimization**
   - Write unit tests for reducers and selectors
   - Test component integration
   - Implement performance optimizations (memoization, selective rendering)

   **AI Task Example:**
   ```
   Create unit tests for the pdfSlice reducer and related selectors in src/state/slices/__tests__/pdfSlice.test.js
   using Jest and React Testing Library. Test all reducer actions and selectors.
   ```

3. **Create Custom Hooks For AI Reuse**
   
   **AI Task Example:**
   ```
   Create a custom hook named usePdfActions.js in src/state/hooks/ that wraps common PDF-related 
   Redux operations. The hook should provide methods for page navigation, zoom control, and text selection
   that use the appropriate Redux actions.
   ```

**Definition of Done:**
- All component state moved to Redux
- No prop drilling between components
- DevTools showing correct state changes
- All components still functioning as before
